# Time-Series-in-R
This repository consists of the different time series forecasting modules in R.
The following methods have been discussed:
1. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) which can be used for discontinuous time datasets
2. Vector Auto Regression (VAR) which can be used for multivaraite time series forecasting of data
